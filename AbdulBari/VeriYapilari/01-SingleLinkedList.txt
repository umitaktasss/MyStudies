What is a Linked List?

A linked list is a data structure used for storing collections of data.
The following properties:
	* Successive elements are connected by pointers
	* The last element points to NULL
	* Can grow or shrink in size during execution of a program.
	* Can be made just as long as required unless system memory exhausts
	* Does not waste memory space (but takes some extra memory for pointers). It allocates memory as list grows.


Main Linked Lists Operations
Insert: Adding an element into the list 
Delete: Removes and returns the specified position element from the list

Auxiliary Linked Lists Operations
Delete List
Count
Find element


Why do we need Linked Lists?

Before explaining why we need Linked List, Let's demonstrate arrays.
As we know, Array and Linked List are both used to store collections of data, since both are used for the same purpose.
They both have different in situations. That means, To use Arrays is suitiable sometimes. To use Linked Lists is suitiable sometimes.

Arrays Properties
	* One memory block is allocated for the entire array to hold the elements of the array.
	* Faster access to the elements. (To access particular element takes O(1) time.)
	* Simple and easy
	* Preallocates all needed memory up front and wastes memory space for indices in the array that are empty.
	* Static size: The size of array is static
	* Complex position-based insertion (Needed to shift existing elements if to insert a element at a given position)

Dynamic Arrays Properties:
	* Dynamic array (Growable, resiable etc)
	* As soon as that array becomes full, create the new array double the size of the original array.

Advantages of Linked list:
	* It can be expanded in constant time.
	* Not waste of memory. To compare with arrays add on new elements doesn't need to do any copying and reallocating.

Disadvanteges:
	* To access element at a given position takes O(n) time.
	* Linked lists waste memory in terms of extra reference points.

Single linked list structure in Python:


To initilize node structure, next pointer and data that has to be store.
class Node:
	def __init__(self,data):
		self.data = data
		self.next = None


As we mentioned before the basic operations:
	* Traverse (To find element or to count the list)
	* Insert (To insert at the beggining or at the end)
	* Delete ()



Traverse in the linked list
	* Start from the head
	* Follow the pointers
	* Display the contents of the nodes (or count) as they are traversed
	* Stop when the next points to NULL
class Linkedlist:
	......... // statements
	......... // statements
	def list_lenght(self):
		current = self.head   #Pointer that points the head
		count = 0             
		while current is not None: # Traverse in the list
			count += 1               
			current = current.next  # Traversing
		return count             
	def find_element(self,data):
		current = self.head     #Pointer that points the head
		index = 0
		while current is not None:  # Traverse in the list
			if current.data == data:  # Element has found
				return True, index
			current = current.next
			index += 1
		return False, -1           # Element is not exist in the list.
	..........// statements
	.........// statements

As you presume, To scane list takes O(n) times for a n size list also space O(1) for creating temporary variable.


Insertion

Inserting at the beginning
In this case:
	Update the next pointer of new node, to point the current head
	Then
	Update head pointer to point the new node
The structure of the class:
We need tail and head to add element in the list O(1) time
class LinkedList:
	def __init__(self):
		self.head = None
		self.tail = None 


	def insert_at_beginning(self,data):
		new_node = Node(data)
		# If elements are not exists
		if self.head is None:
			self.head = new_node
			self.tail = new_node
			return
		
		new_node.next = self.head
		self.head = new_node
Time Complexity: O(1)
Space Complexity: O(1)
Inserting at end:
In this case we need to update the tail node.
As same as with inserting at beginning.
First tail node points the new node, then update the tail node
	def insert_at_end(self,data):
		new_node = Node(data)
		#If elements are not exists 
		if self.head and self.tail is None:
			self.head = new_node
			self.tail = new_node
		else:
			self.tail.next = new_node
			self.tail = new_node
Time complexity: O(1) (due to direct access to the tail)
Space Complexity : O(1)
Inserting in Position:

In this case we need to traverse in the list and also  we need to modify two next pointers.

Example If we want to add an element at position 3 then we stop at position 2. That means we traverse 2 nodes and insert the new node.
Position pointer and position_tail pointer

	def insert_at_position(self, position, data):
		new_node = Node(data)

		#To insert element in first position
		if position == 0:
			self.insert_at_beggining()
			return
		else:
			current = self.head  #To traverse in the list
			previous = None      #Previous (position_tail) pointer 
			index = 0

		while current is not None and index < position: 
			previous = current
			current = current.next
			index += 1 # Increase the index

		if previous is not None: 
			new_node.next = current 
			previous.next = new_node
			if new_node.next is None:
                    self.tail = new_node
       else:
           print("Position out of bounds")
   



Let's sum up all the cases.
O(1) for inserting element at beginning and ending
O(n) for inserting element in a specific index (ofc if it's not beginning or end)




Deleting Operation
	* Deleting first node
	* Deleting the last node
	* Deleting an intermediate node


Deleting First Node

First node (current head node) is removed from the list
It can be done in two step:
	Create a temporary node that holds the head node.
	Then move the head nodes pointer to the next node and delete temporary node.

	def delete_at_beginning(self):
		
		if self.head is None:
			print("The list is empty.")
			return

		temp = self.head
		self.head = self.head.next

		del temp
	Time complexity : O(1)
	Space complexity O(1) (due to temporary node)
Deleting the Last Node

In this case, we need to traverse in the list and find previous node which before the tail. We're going to use two node temp_tail and previous_tail. Update tail to the previous node. Then update previous node next to null.
delete temp_tail

	def delete_at_end(self):
		if self.head is None:
			print("The list is empty.")
			return
		if self.head == self.tail:
			self.head = None
			self.tail = None
			return

		temp_tail = self.head
		previous = None

		while temp_tail is not None:
			previous = temp_tail
			temp_tail = temp_tail.next
		
		self.tail = previous
		previous.next = None
		
		del temp_tail
		Time complexity: O(n) (due to traversing)
		Space complexity: O(1)

Deleting Node at position:

	In this case, the node to removed has to be between two nodes.
		We need two pointer to traverse in the list. Two pointer which points the node to be deleted and other is the node right before the node to be deleted.
		First keep traverse at the exact point: Once we find the node to be deleted, change the previous node's next pointer to the next pointer of the node to be deleted.
		dispose of the current node to be deleted.

	def delete_node_at_position(self, position):
		if self.head is None:
			print("List is empty.")
			return
		if position == 0:
			self.delete_at_beginning()
			return
		current = self.head
		previous = None
		index = 0

		while current is not None and index < position:
			previous = current
			current = current.next
			index +=1

		if current is None:
			print("Position does not exist.")
			return
		previous.next = current.next
		del current
		Time complexity: O(n) (due to traversing)
		Space complexity: O(1)
To Delete the List

	This works by storing the current node in some temporary variable and freeing the current node. After freeing the current node,
	go to the next node with a temporary variable and repeat this process for all nodes.
	
	def delete_list(self):
		current = self.head

		while current:
			auxiliary_node = current.next
			print(f"Deleting node with data: {current.data}")
			del current
			current = auxiliary_node
		
		self.head = None
		self.tail = None

	Time Complexity : O(n), for scanning the complete list of size n
	Space : O(1)

To print the list
	This works by traversing the current node and showing the data.

def display(self):
    current = self.head
    while current:
        print(current.data, end=" -> " if current.next else "\n")
        current = current.next
	Time complexity: O(n)
	Space complexity: O(1)
