Unrolled linked lists

One of the biggest advantages of linked lists over arrays is that inserting an element at any location takes only O(1) time. However, it takes O(n) to search for an
element in a linked list. There is a simple varation of the singly linked list called unrolled linked lists.

**An unrolled linked list stores multiple elements in each node. In each block, a circular list is used to connect all nodes.

Assume that there will be no more than n elements in the unrolled linked list at any time. To simplify this problem, all blocks, except the last one, should contain exactly 
ceiling n^(1/2). 

Searching for an element in Unrolled Linked lists:
	In unrolled linked lists, we can find the k^th element in O(n^(1/2))
